- **Summary**: This paper develops a comprehensive taxonomy of ethical and social risks associated with large-scale language models (LMs). It identifies twenty-one risks and categorizes them into six risk areas to guide responsible innovation and mitigation strategies.

### Problem 
- Large-scale LMs pose various ethical and social risks that need to be anticipated, understood, and mitigated to ensure responsible innovation.
- Existing research has identified potential risks, but no comprehensive taxonomy has been proposed to systematically evaluate these risks.

### Contributions
- **Taxonomy**: Development of a comprehensive taxonomy categorizing twenty-one ethical and social risks associated with LMs into six areas:
  - Discrimination, Hate Speech, and Exclusion
  - Information Hazards
  - Misinformation Harms
  - Malicious Uses
  - Human-Computer Interaction Harms
  - Environmental and Socioeconomic Harms
- **Risk Analysis**: Detailed analysis of observed and anticipated risks, discussing their causal mechanisms, evidence, and mitigation approaches.
- **Guiding Action**: The taxonomy aims to facilitate the identification and mitigation of risks, contributing to responsible decision-making in LM development.

### Method
- **Interdisciplinary Workshops**: Conducted horizon-scanning workshops with researchers from various fields to surface observed and anticipated risks.
- **Literature Review**: Supplemented workshop findings with an in-depth literature review from computer science, linguistics, social sciences, and policy papers.
- **Taxonomy Development**: Analyzed common themes to structure the risk landscape into six categories.

### Result
- **Utility**: The taxonomy serves to map out challenges in LM research, inform public discourse, and support responsible decision-making.
- **Observed and Anticipated Risks**: Provided a detailed account of observed risks and a coarser overview of anticipated risks, with a focus on potential harm, evidence, and mitigation strategies.

### Limitations and Assumptions of this paper
- Focuses on risks associated with operating LMs, not on training or multimodal models.
- Primarily discusses current state-of-the-art LMs, with some extrapolation to future risks based on existing trends.

### Conclusion
- The taxonomy provides a structured framework to understand and address the ethical and social risks of LMs.
- Emphasizes the need for continuous engagement with multiple perspectives and communities for effective risk mitigation.
- Highlights the responsibility of organizations to implement the proposed mitigations and contribute to responsible LM development.

### Future work
- Engage further perspectives to expand the taxonomy.
- Innovate on analysis and evaluation methods.
- Develop and stress-test mitigation tools for responsible LM innovation.
